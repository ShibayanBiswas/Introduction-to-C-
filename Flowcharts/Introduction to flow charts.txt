Steps for writing a program-
1. Analyse your problem
2. Break down your problem into smaller subparts
3. Write down solution on paper
4. Verify your solution with test cases
5. Write down the code(here we will get less errors while converting the solution that we have written in paper into code)
6. By using flow charts we can write our solution

What is a flow chart?
1. Diagramatic representation illustrating a solution to a given problem
2. Allows you to break down any process into smaller steps and display them in a visually pleasing way

Flowchart components-(For our programming always read flowchart from top to bottom)
	Start	                (Terminator)	This is used for initiating the start of our program and we also have End as our terminator that helps us to go out of the program
	Read N	                (Input/Output)	Here by N we declare a storage in the memory of the computer in terms of an input which can be singular or plural and it also refers to the computed value that is stored in a memory location of the computer for output
	Let Sum=0,I=1	        (Process)	Here we are initialising our two variables for further use in the program as a part of the process
	Is I greater than N?	(Decision)	Here it is taking a decesion to do certain tasks based on truth of a condition else follow the other tasks if the condition is false


Note- 
1. Arrows(vertical pointing downwards) are used in flow chart to represent flow of control in the program represented by the order in the topic "Flowchart components"
2. There is another component in flowcharts known as connectors that we will be doing while discussing functions

Examples-

1. Add Two Numbers
	Start
	  |
	Read a,b
          |
	c=a+b
          |
	Print c
          |
	 End

2. Calculating the Simple Interest
	 Start
	   |
	Read P,R,T
	   |
	SI=P*R*T/100
	   |
	Print SI
	   |
	  End
